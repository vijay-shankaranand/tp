## Choo Tze Jie's Project Portfolio Page

### Project: JobFestGo

JobFestGo is a **desktop application** built for job festival event planners in Singapore to manage contacts and tasks for their events.

Here’s an **overview** of how JobFestGo can help you with your event planning:
- Store information about your events and their associated contacts
- Track status of your event tasks
- Keep track of upcoming task deadlines
- Search for contacts by name or tag

JobFestGo incorporates both a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** and a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** to provide convenience and organisation for job festival event planners when managing their event-specific contacts and tasks. 

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=tjch-o&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  - Implemented the `view_tags` feature
    - What it does: Displays a list of all existing tags.
    - Justification: Improves the product by allowing users to remember contacts of a certain category that they can contact for events.
    - Highlights: This enhancement was challenging because I was not familiar with JavaFx and the codebase that handles the UI, which made debugging difficult.
  - Implemented the`view_events` feature
    - What it does: Displays a list of all existing events.
    - Justification: Improves the product by allowing users to remember all the events they are involved in so far.
    - Highlights: Implementation was slightly challenging due to the added complexity of conditional rendering.
  - Implemented the `home` feature
    - What it does: Returns to the home page from the current screen.
    - Justification: Improves the product by acting as a reset after executing other commands and users can then proceed with additional actions.
    - Highlights: Coming up with the implementation was challenging since I had to figure out how to reset all the filters for the event, contact and task list and have it be reflected in the UI.

* **Contributions to the UG**:
  - Contributed to the sections related to the commands I have created, where I mainly explained how to use the commands.
  - Continuously reviewed and modified the user guide, ensuring its logical flow to eliminate potential confusion among users.
  - Done meticulous proofreading to avoid various types of errors including grammar, spelling and punctuation.
  - Dedicated time to familiarise myself with MarkBind's syntax and utilised my CSS and Bootstrap expertise to enhance the user guide's visual appeal. I incorporated custom command summary boxes, error boxes and icons that align with the theme of JobFestGo while improving the look of the warning boxes.

* **Contributions to the DG**:
  - Did up the `view_tags` feature as well as its use-cases.
  - Did up the `view_events` feature as well as its use-cases.
  - Did up the `home` feature as well as its use-cases.
  - Added the implementation of the home feature and supplemented the explanation with UML diagrams.
  - Helped to proofread the DG and update some of the diagrams that used old command words.

* **Contributions to team-based tasks**:
  - Updated the app icon.
  - Helped in the ideation and experimentation of the frontend.
  - Updated the codebase as well as the DG and UG and renamed all methods, variables etc. that previously contained `Person` in their name into `Contact`
  - Voluntarily contributed in writing additional test cases for code that I have not authored to ensure more comprehensive test coverage
