# Tong Xinyao's Project Portfolio Page

### Project: JobFestGo

JobFestGo is a **desktop application** built for job event planners to manage contacts and tasks for their events.

Here’s an **overview** of how JobFestGo can help you with your event planning:
- Store information about your events and their associated contacts
- Keep track of relevant tasks for each event
- Stay on schedule with automated deadline reminders
- Search for contacts by name or tag

Optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, JobFestGo is a management tool tailored for **job festival event planners**. With systematic organization of contacts and tasks, you can **enhance productivity** and **streamline your workflow** effortlessly!
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  - Implemented the `filter_by_tag` feature
    - What it does: allows the user to filter contacts in JobFestGo by their tags.
    - Justification: This feature improves user experience by enabling the user to quickly access specific groups of contacts, saving their time and effort.
  - Implemented the `link` and `unlink`feature
    - What it does: allows the user to associate contacts with specific event or undo the association.
    - Justification: This feature improves the product by providing the user with an additional way of organizing their network.
    - Highlight: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. I took a slightly more challenging path in order to enhance user experience.
  - Implemented the `delete_task` feature
    - What it does: allows the user to delete tasks from their associated events in JobFestGo.
    - Justification: This feature is essential since the user may mistakenly add wrong tasks and would need to delete them.
  - Implemented the `mark_task` and `unmark_task` feature
    - What it does: allows the user to mark a task as completed or not completed in JobFestGo.
    - Justification: This feature improves user experience by enabling the user to easily track the progress of their tasks and plan their work accordingly.
